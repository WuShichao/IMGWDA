* TODO Astrophysical sources of gravitational waves [%]

** REVIEW Compact binary coalescences
** REVIEW Continuous wave sources
   + [ ] Add a P-Pdot diagram, possibly with some of the O1/O2 data.
** REVIEW Stochastic sources
   + [ ] Add a plot of the energy of the stochastic background.
** TODO Burst sources [1/3]
   + [ ] Fix CCSN plot- this is just wrong.
   + [X] Add a figure for the ad-hoc waveforms
     This plot should probably still be checked over however.
   + [ ] Add a figure for the semi-modelled waveforms
   + [ ] Add a figure for the supernova waveforms
** TODO Minke and burst searches [0/4]
   + [ ] Discuss calibration uncertainties
   + [ ] Various data formats required
   + [ ] Signal production process (signal → ant pattern → noise)
   + [ ] APPENDIX: Example script for MDC production
