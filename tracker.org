#+TITLE: Topics in gravitational wave astronomy
A thesis.


* TODO Gravitational waves: generation, propagation, and detection [0/9]

+ Probably shouldn't use characteristic strain for the plots
+ Is equation 2.3 really in the right place?
+ No formalism for how we expect a CBC signal to evolve in phase as well as amplitude
+ Should I really call them spline surroagte models → just surrogate models?

   + [ ] Add discussion of LIGO india
*** TODO  Advanced LIGO [0/1]
    + [ ] Should add discussion of the LIGO India project here.
*** TODO Advanced VIRGO [0/0]

* TODO Astrophysical sources of gravitational waves [0/5]
** REVIEW Compact binary coalescences [0/4]
   + [ ] Improve list of IMR and SEO versions
   + [ ] Add discussion of SXS catalogue
   + [ ] Waveform cartoon with inspiral merger ringdown marked on
   + [ ] Discussion of tidal effects in NS
   + [ ] Discussion of PN accurate waveforms
** REVIEW Continuous wave sources
   + [ ] Add a P-Pdot diagram, possibly with some of the O1/O2 data.
** REVIEW Stochastic sources
   + [ ] Add a plot of the energy of the stochastic background.
** TODO Burst sources [5/7]
   + [X] Fix CCSN plot- this is just wrong.
   + [ ] Complete discussion of search methods
   + [X] Add a figure for the ad-hoc waveforms
     This plot should probably still be checked over however.
   + [X] Add a figure for the supernova waveforms
   + [ ] Add a very brief discussion of SN models
   + [X] Complete the discussion of burst parameters
   + [X] Complete the discussion of null streams
+ Call characteristic squared "hrss"
+ Encounter waveforms reference from Siong
+ Supernova section needs work
+ Consider changing the searches section to a transient one
+ Fundamental search methods section
+ Cartoon to illustrate the signal construction diagrams
+ Make sure that coherent and incoherent diagrams visually distinct
** TODO Minke and burst searches [3/5]
   + [X] Discuss calibration uncertainties
   + [X] Various data formats required
   + [X] Signal production process (signal → ant pattern → noise)
   + [ ] APPENDIX: Example script for MDC production
   + [ ] Add discussion of the sensitivity results from O1 and O2 MDCs.
