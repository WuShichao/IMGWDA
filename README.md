# Topics in Gravitational Wave Astronomy
Daniel Williams

This repository contains the text and code necessary to produce my thesis.

The `chapters` directory contains the text of the thesis in `org-mode`
format. These can be converted to numerous other formats using scripts
in the `scripts/build` directory, with the makefile capable of
producing these itself.
