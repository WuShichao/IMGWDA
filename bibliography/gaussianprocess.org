   :ABSTRACT: Several studies independently have shown that concrete strength development is determined not only by the water-to-cement ratio, but that it also is influenced by the content of other concrete ingredients. High-performance concrete is a highly complex material, which makes modeling its behavior a very difficult task. This paper is aimed at demonstrating the possibilities of adapting artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the compressive strength of high-performance concrete. A set of trial batches of \{HPC\} was produced in the laboratory and demonstrated satisfactory experimental results. This study led to the following conclusions: 1) A strength model based on \{ANN\} is more accurate than a model based on regression analysis; and 2) It is convenient and easy to use \{ANN\} models for numerical experiments to review the effects of the proportions of each variable on the concrete mix.
