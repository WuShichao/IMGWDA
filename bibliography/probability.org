*** Abstract
    Astronomers are often confronted with funky populations and
    distributions of objects: brighter objects are more likely to be
    detected; targets are selected based on colour cuts; imperfect
    classification yields impure samples. Failing to account for these
    effects leads to biased analyses. In this paper we present a simple
    overview of a Bayesian consideration of sample selection, giving
    solutions to both analytically tractable and intractable models. This
    is accomplished via a combination of analytic approximations and
    Monte Carlo integration, in which dataset simulation is efficiently
    used to correct for issues in the observed dataset. This methodology
    is also applicable for data truncation, such as requiring densities
    to be strictly positive. Toy models are included for demonstration,
    along with discussions of numerical considerations and how to
    optimise for implementation. We provide sample code to demonstrate
    the techniques. The methods in this paper should be widely applicable
    in fields beyond astronomy, wherever sample selection effects occur.

*** Abstract
    When searching for gravitational waves in the data from
    ground-based gravitational wave detectors it is common to use a
    detection threshold to reduce the number of background events
    which are unlikely to be the signals of interest. However,
    imposing such a threshold will also discard some real signals with
    low amplitude, which can potentially bias any inferences drawn
    from the population of detected signals. We show how this
    selection bias is naturally avoided by using the full information
    from the search, considering both the selected data and our
    ignorance of the data that are thrown away, and considering all
    relevant signal and noise models. This approach produces unbiased
    estimates of parameters even in the presence of false alarms and
    incomplete data. This can be seen as an extension of previous
    methods into the high false rate regime where we are able to show
    that the quality of parameter inference can be optimised by
    lowering thresholds and increasing the false alarm rate.
