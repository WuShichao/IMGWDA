   abstract    = {We present a framework for sparse Gaussian process (GP)
                 methods which uses forward selection with criteria based
                 on information-theoretic principles, previously suggested
                 for active learning. Our goal is not only to learn
                 d-sparse predictors (which can be evaluated in O(d)
                 rather than O(n), d much smaller than n, n the number of
                 training points), but also to perform training under
                 strong restrictions on time and memory requirements. The
                 scaling of our method is at most O(n d^2), and in large
                 real-world classification experiments we show that it can
                 match prediction performance of the popular support
                 vector machine (SVM), yet can be significantly faster in
                 training. In contrast to the SVM, our approximation
                 produces estimates of predictive probabilities ("error
                 bars"), allows for Bayesian model selection and is less
                 complex in implementation.},

abstract = {Kernel methods are among the most popular techniques in machine learning. From a frequentist/discriminative perspective they play a central role in regularization theory as they provide a natural choice for the hypotheses space and the regularization functional through the notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. From a Bayesian/generative perspective they are the key in the context of Gaussian processes, where the kernel function is also known as the covariance function. Traditionally, kernel methods have been used in supervised learning problem with scalar outputs and indeed there has been a considerable amount of work devoted to designing and learning kernels. More recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple outputs, motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning. In this paper, we review different methods to design or learn valid kernel functions for multiple outputs, paying particular attention to the connection between probabilistic and functional methods.},

@article{Ambikasaran2014,
abstract = {A number of problems in probability and statistics can be addressed using the multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the one-dimensional case, computing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the evaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the {\$}n{\$}-dimensional setting, however, it requires the inversion of an {\$}n \backslashtimes n{\$} covariance matrix, {\$}C{\$}, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, {\$}\backslashdet(C){\$}. In many cases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of the form {\$}C = \backslashsigma{\^{}}2 I + K{\$}, where {\$}K{\$} is computed using a specified covariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters (hyperparameters). The matrix {\$}C{\$} is typically dense, causing standard direct methods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require {\$}\backslashmathcal O(n{\^{}}3){\$} work. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling. Here, we show that for the most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix {\$}C{\$} can be hierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the identity matrix, yielding an {\$}\backslashmathcal O (n\backslashlog{\^{}}2 n) {\$} algorithm for inversion. More importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the determinant {\$}\backslashdet(C){\$}, permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in high dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining {\$}K{\$}. Our fast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of hyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination of nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance computing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable problems. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariance kernels.},

abstract = {This book is aimed at senior undergraduates and graduate students in Engineering, Science, Mathematics, and Computing. It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

This model accommodates input dependent signal and noise correlations between multiple response variables, input dependent length-scales and amplitudes, and heavy-tailed predictive distributions. We derive both efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes inference procedures for this model. We apply GPRN as a multiple output regression and multivariate volatility model, demonstrating substantially improved performance over eight popular multiple output (multi-task) Gaussian process models and three multivariate volatility models on benchmark datasets, including a 1000 dimensional gene expression dataset.},

abstract="We present possible observing scenarios for the Advanced
                  LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA gravitational-wave
                  detectors over the next decade, with the intention
                  of providing information to the astronomy community
                  to facilitate planning for multi-messenger astronomy
                  with gravitational waves. We estimate the
                  sensitivity of the network to transient
                  gravitational-wave signals, and study the capability
                  of the network to determine the sky location of the
                  source. We report our findings for
                  gravitational-wave transients, with particular focus
                  on gravitational-wave signals from the inspiral of
                  binary neutron star systems, which are the most
                  promising targets for multi-messenger astronomy. The
                  ability to localize the sources of the detected
                  signals depends on the geographical distribution of
                  the detectors and their relative sensitivity, and
                  {\$}{\$}90{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$} 90 {\%} credible
                  regions can be as large as thousands of square
                  degrees when only two sensitive detectors are
                  operational. Determining the sky position of a
                  significant fraction of detected signals to areas of
                  5-- {\$}{\$}20{\textasciitilde}{\backslash}mathrm
                  {\{}deg{\}}^2{\$}{\$} 20 deg 2 requires at least
                  three detectors of sensitivity within a factor of
                  {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sim 2{\$}{\$} ∼ 2 of each other
                  and with a broad frequency bandwidth. When all
                  detectors, including KAGRA and the third LIGO
                  detector in India, reach design sensitivity, a
                  significant fraction of gravitational-wave signals
                  will be localized to a few square degrees by
                  gravitational-wave observations alone.",
