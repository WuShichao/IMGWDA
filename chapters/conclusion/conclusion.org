In this thesis I have attempted to provide a broad overview of the broad field of abbr:gw research, ranging from the development of detectors capable of making observations of the minute displacements produced by propagating gravitational waves, to the various astrophysical systems which are expected to produce observable abpl:gw.

The arrival of the first abbr:gw detection in September 2015 ushered-in a new era of observational abbr:gw astronomy, and with it a number of new challenges.
The work presented in this thesis is an attempt to address some of these challenges.
The development of the Heron waveform model, which is detailed in chapter ref:cha:heron, is an attempt to address the need both for more accurate models of abbr:bbh signals, but also to incorporate understanding of the uncertainty of these models into analyses which make use of them. 
Heron, as a model which is fundamentally probabilistic in nature, provides a method for interpolating between highly-accurate abbr:nr waveforms, in order to give model coverage over a large region of the intrinsic parameter space for abbr:bbh systems, while also providing a measure of the uncertainty of the interpolant, which can then be included in the overall uncertainty associated with the analysis.
In this thesis I demonstrate the ability of this model to produce abbr:bbh waveforms across their parameter space, and make comparisons between the output of the Heron model and other approximant models.
Much work remains in order to make this waveform suitable for use in parameter estimation studies, or other analyses.
While the accuracy of the model is currently tested by calculating mismatch between its outputs and other models' outputs there is scope for additional testing to further validate the model, and ensuring that the model produces parameter estimates for known signals which are consistent with those found using other approximant models would be essential for Heron to be an alternative to these.
There is much potential for future developments in the model, including properly handling source orientation, producing waveforms with longer inspirals, and incorporating data from more than one abbr:nr catalogue in an attempt to account for systematic biases which may be present in an individual catalogue, as well as providing a larger quantity of training data.

The first multimessenger observation involving abpl:gw occurred in August 2017, with the observation of gls:gw170817, and its associated abbr:sgrb, and later emission across the abbr:em spectrum.
Multimessenger observations provide new possibilities for inferring properties and understanding the mechanisms of highly energetic astrophysical systems.
One example of such a system is the production of abpl:sgrb.
Abpl:gw can provide insight into the progenitors of these events, such as abbr:bns events.
In chapter ref:cha:gamma-ray-burst I discuss the development of a technique which is capable of inferring the opening angle of abpl:sgrb based on the observed rate of both abbr:bns and abbr:sgrb events in the local universe.
While this technique, which was developed before the observation of gls:gw170817 and its associated abbr:sgrb, makes some assumptions which may seem naive in light of the unusual nature of this abbr:sgrb (specifically my choice of a top-hat jet model, and the low luminosity of GRB 170817A which has led to this model being disfavoured since 2017) its hierarchical nature will allow the technique to be adapted to other jet models, and for the model to be incorporated into a larger model which considers both a larger quantity of data provided by abpl:gw detectors, and observations from other regions of the abbr:em spectrum.

The approach outlined in chapter ref:cha:gamma-ray-burst relies on understanding the rate of abbr:gw events; in order to infer this rate the sensitivity of the abbr:gw detectors must be well-understood.
This task is non-trivial, as the noise present in measurements from these detectors is both non-stationary and evolves over time.
The range of the detectors, which is affected by their sensitivity, is measured by ``injecting'' known signals, produced from theoretical models, into real, noisy data from the detectors.
By injecting signals at a variety of amplitudes, corresponding to a range of distances, and determining which can be recovered by an analysis, allows the sensitivity of the detector over time to be estimated.
A technique for producing these ``mock data challenges'' (and its implementation in the Minke python package) for transient signals is described in ref:cha:searches, along with an overview of how the unmodelled searches, which these challenges are intended to test, operate.

The field of abbr:gw astronomy is developing rapidly, but as a young field, the future is likely to bring many surprises, and there are likely to be many sources of abpl:gw which have yet to be considered. 
In chapter ref:cha:sources I discuss a number of sources which are considered likely to produce abpl:gw, but in section ref:sec:sources:burst:encounters:waveforms I present a preliminary study on the detectability of a source which has not been widely considered: encounters between black holes, and the potential capture of one black hole by another which results in a abbr:bbh coalescence event. 
I show that this source is likely to be detectable with the current generation of detectors in galaxies beyond the Local Group, and is a promising event type to be observed by burst search algorithms of the type discussed in chapter ref:cha:searches.

There is scope for the continuation of all of the work which was started for this thesis, from the development of the hierarchical abbr:sgrb beaming angle analysis into part of a modern analysis for more sophisticated models, to the creation of a full waveform model from the Heron model. 
The results on the detectability of black hole encounters and captures makes it clear that a search for these signals may be a fruitful use of resources, while the use of Minke to determine the sensitivity of burst searches will continue throughout the advanced detector era, and potentially beyond.
