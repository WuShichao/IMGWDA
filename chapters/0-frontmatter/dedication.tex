If I've learned nothing else in my time working in the Institute for Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow, 
and living in a city just a short drive south of the Scottish Highlands, 
it is that completing a PhD and climbing a mountain have their similarities.

While at times the weather is fine, and you have a clear view of the task before you,
more often than not you find yourself walking through low cloud, and trying to pick out a 
well-concealed path, or searching for that same path after you've strayed away from it.

The journey is tiring, and there are times that it seems like it would just be easier to turn around, and go back to the flat,
but the promise of the fine view at the top, and the achievement of reaching it are a strong motivation.

While there are times that one finds oneself climbing alone, it is a rare expedition where you are completely alone.
There are those who show us the way, and in the last few years many people have helped me gain my bearings; 
\ldots{}

There are others who set off on a journey with you, but take different paths, making their own way to the top; 
without the perspective of my fellow postgraduate students my experience here would have been undoubtedly poorer,
and my chances of success certainly slimmer.
