The 14th September 2016 will likely be remembered as one of the most
significant in the history of astronomy and of astrophysics. Early in
the morning of this autumn day, shortly after 9am UT, a gravitational
wave passed through the Earth, and on its way produced a sufficiently
large movement in the mirrors and test masses of the detectors of the
[[abbr:ligo]], as to be detected.

Over five months of data analysis, detector characterisation, and
detection verification were conducted by a global team of scientists, in
the [[abbr:lvc]]. This process resulted
in a slew of journal papers being written, vast quantities of data
produced, and an enormous public outreach effort to be launched.
Eventually, the collaboration found itself in a position to make the
announcement of the first direct detection of gravitational waves,
[[gls:gw150914]], on 11 February 2016.

[[gls:gw150914]] is not the first evidence for gravitational waves, with the
Hulse-Taylor pulsar cite:1975ApJ...195L..51H,2005ASPC..328...25W having
provided compelling indirect evidence which lead to its discoverers
receiving the 1993 Nobel Prize.
