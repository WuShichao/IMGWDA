I've had the pleasure of being a member of the Institute for
Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow for a little over
seven months. It would be difficult to deny that this has been an
unexpectedly eventful period in the life of the group, and it's been
great fun to experience the excitement of the first detection of a
gravitational wave as an insider (although an insider only by the skin
of my teeth), and to see the department's work on the LISA Pathfinder
mission come to fruition just a few months later.  It has been a joy
to be a part of the gravitational wave community at the birth of this
new observational science.
