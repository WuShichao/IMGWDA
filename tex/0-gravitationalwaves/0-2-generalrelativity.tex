Gravitational waves are one of the predictions of Einstein's 1915
Theory of General Relativity.


The Einstein field equations are non-linear, and analytical solutions
aren't possible. In order to perform calculations in general
relativity it is possible to turn to  \emph{post-Newtonian} expansion. 

The lowest-order expansion from which radiation is produced is the
quadrupole order, which depends upon the density and velocity field of
the system. The quadrupole tensor is defined
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  Q_{jk} = \int \rho x_k x_k \dd[3]{x}
\end{equation}
and the gravitational wave is described by the three-tensor
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  h_{jk} = \frac{2}{r} \dv[2]{Q_{jk}}{t}
\end{equation}
