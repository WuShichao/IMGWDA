Gravitational waves are one of the predictions of Einstein's 1915
Theory of General Relativity\cite{1915SPAW.......844E}, with the first
theoretical prediction of their existence being proposed by Einstein
in 1916\cite{1937FrInJ.223...43E,1918SPAW.......154E}, less than a
year after the publication of the general theory, however research
work in this area remained largely stagnant until the 1960s, when
interest in the field picked-up


The Einstein field equations are non-linear, and analytical solutions
aren't possible. In order to perform calculations in general
relativity it is possible to turn to  \emph{post-Newtonian} expansion. 

The lowest-order expansion from which radiation is produced is the
quadrupole order, which depends upon the density and velocity field of
the system. The quadrupole tensor is defined
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  Q_{jk} = \int \rho x_k x_k \dd[3]{x}
\end{equation}
and the gravitational wave is described by the three-tensor
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  h_{jk} = \frac{2}{r} \dv[2]{Q_{jk}}{t}
\end{equation}
