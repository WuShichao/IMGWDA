\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{he 14 September 2016} will likely be remembered as one of the most
significant in the history of astronomy and of astrophysics. Early in
the morning of this autumn day, shortly after 9am UT, a gravitational
wave passed through the Earth, and on its way produced a sufficiently
large movement in the mirrors and test masses of the detectors of the
Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (\gls{ligo}), as to be
detected.

Over five months of data analysis, detector characterisation, and
detection verification were conducted by a global team of scientists,
in the LIGO and VIRGO Scientific Collaboration (LVC). This process
resulted in a slew of journal papers being written, vast quantities of
data produced, and an enormous public outreach effort to be
launched. Eventually, the collaboration found itself in a position to
make the announcement of the first direct detection of gravitational
waves, GW150914, on 11 February 2016.

GW150914 is not the first evidence for gravitational waves, with the
Hulse-Taylor pulsar\cite{1975ApJ...195L..51H,2005ASPC..328...25W}
having provided compelling indirect evidence which lead to its
discoverers receiving the 1993 Nobel Prize.
