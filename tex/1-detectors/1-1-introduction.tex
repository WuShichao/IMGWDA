The earliest attempts to develop a gravitational wave detector were
made in the 1960s with the experiments of Joseph Weber (1919--2000) at
the University of Maryland, from which he claimed the first detection
in 1969\cite{1969PhRvL..22.1320W,1970PhRvL..24..276W} of signals
originating in the galactic centre\cite{1970PhRvL..25..180W}. Numerous
attempts to confirm his findings were unsuccessful, including searches
in Ronald Drever's (1931--1917) group at the University of Glasgow
\cite{1973Natur.246..340D} in the UK; at Bell Labs
\cite{1973PhRvL..31..173L,1973PhRvL..31..176G,1974PhRvL..33..794L} in
the USA; at Munich\cite{1975NCimL..12..111B,1975NCimL..12..111B} in
Germany; at Moscow\cite{1973PhLA...45..271B} in Russia; and at
Tokyo\cite{1975PhRvL..35..890H} in Japan. While Weber's original
detections were soundly refuted by the community there is little doubt
that the announcement led to a flurry of activity in the field. This
ultimately lead to the development of modern cryogenic resonant bars,
such as ALTAIR\cite{1992NCimC..15..943B},
ALLEGRO\cite{2000IJMPD...9..229M}, NAUTILUS\cite{1997APh.....7..231A},
and EXPLORER\cite{1993PhRvD..47..362A}; and laser interferometers.

Laser interferometers, of which advanced LIGO is an implementation,
were the result of a quest for both higher sensitivities and
bandwidth. The possibility of using a Michelson interferometer to
measure the distance between test masses in order to detect
gravitational radiation originated in Moscow\cite{1963JETP...16..433G}
in 1963.  This approach was followed early-on by Scottish and German
groups as a means of improving on resonant bar sensitivities, with a
3-meter and later a 30-meter prototype detector constructed at
Garching in the late
1970s\cite{1979JPhE...12.1043B,1988PhRvD..38..423S} which used optical
delay lines, and a 1-meter prototype, and later a 10-meter instrument
were built at Glasgow in the early
1980s\cite{1979RSPSA.368...11D,1995RScI...66.4447R}, which used
Fabry-Perot cavities . The Glasgow detector was the spiritual
predecessor to the CalTech 40-meter
prototype\cite{1996PhLA..218..157A}. The increasing maturity of
technology developed by these prototypes lead to the construction of
the first generation of long-baseline detectors, starting with TAMA in
Tokyo\cite{1996JKASS..29..279K}, the joint UK-German GEO600
detector\cite{1997CQGra..14.1471L} near Hannover, and the two
kilometre-scale detectors, the joint CalTech-MIT detectors
LIGO\cite{1992Sci...256..325A}, located at two sites in the USA, and
the joint Italian-French detector VIRGO\cite{1990NIMPA.289..518B},
near Cascina. These detectors were operated during the 2000s, and
while none of them made a detection of gravitational waves, they
provided valuable astrophysical results by placing astrophysical
limits on the strength of the stochastic gravitational wave background
\cite{2014PhRvL.113w1101A}, production of gravitational waves by
pulsars\cite{2014ApJ...785..119A} and gamma ray
bursts\cite{2012ApJ...760...12A}, and the rate of compact binary
coalescence in the local
universe\cite{2012PhRvD..85h2002A,2013PhRvD..87b2002A}.

Figure \ref{fig:first-gen-asd} is a plot of the ASD of the first
generation of interferometric detectors, in which it is clear that
these detectors have considerable advantages not only in senstivity
compared to resonant bar detectors, but can also observe over a much
greater bandwidth.

The initial-generation of detectors were upgraded during the first
half of the 2010s, leading to Advanced LIGO\cite{2015CQGra..32g4001L}
which resumed observations in September 2015, and the imminent start
of observations from the Advanced VIRGO
detector\cite{2015CQGra..32b4001A}, with the prospect of a joint run
occuring during the second half of 2016. The GEO detector was the
first of the initial detectors to be fully upgraded becoming GEO-HF
\cite{2006CQGra..23S.207W}, with improved sensitivity at high
frequencies. Japanese efforts have focussed on the development of
KAGRA (formerly LCGT), a cryogenic interferometer located deep
underground in the Kamioka mine\cite{1999IJMPD...8..557K}, although
the project has suffered from a number of set-backs. The construction
of a third LIGO detector interferometer in India using the mothballed
second detector from the Washington site has now moved into its
initial stages, with the prospect of this detector joining the network
around the end of the decade. Figure \ref{fig:aligo-design-asd}
depicts the anticipated ASD of the advanced LIGO detectors once they
have reached their design sensitivity, which is anticipated within the
next five years.

  The second-generation detectors, specifically the two Advanced LIGO
  detectors were responsible for the first discovery of gravitational
  waves\cite{2016PhRvL.116m1103A}, and have successfully demonstrated
  the ability of interferometry to observe the gravitational
  universe. This said, future improvements in sensitivity are highly
  desirable, but are likely to be even more technically challenging
  than the transition from resonant bars to laser interferometers. In
  order to improve the bandwidth of detectors a location free of
  \emph{Newtonian noise} must be found, which ultimately mandates the
  placement of an interferometer in space. There have been a number of
  proposals for a space-based interferometer, with
  eLISA\cite{2013GWN.....6....4A} likely to be the first to launch in
  the 2030s; the technology demonstration mission for eLISA,
  \emph{LISA Pathfinder} was launched in December 2015, and its main
  mission was completed in early 2016\cite{2016PhRvL.116w1101A}. The
  eLISA detector will be sensitive in the milli-hertz region of the
  gravitational wave spectrum, and will be capable of observing binary
  inspirals at a much earlier stage in their evolution than the
  advanced ground-based detectors, as well as the galactic population
  of low-mass binaries, such as binary white dwarfs. A Japanese
  proposal, DECIGO\cite{2011CQGra..28i4011K}, would observe in the
  decihertz regime using a complex arrangement of six spacecraft in a
  star-of-David configuration. There are also plans for more sensitive
  detectors on the ground. The Einstein telescope is a European
  proposal for an underground kilometre-scale detector in a triangular
  configuration, using a ``xylophone'' configuration to improve
  broadband sensitivity compared to the second-generation of
  detectors; its scientific aims include providing more sensitive
  tests of general relativity than are possible with the advanced
  detectors\cite{2012CQGra..29l4013S}. There are also proposals for
  upgrades of the advanced detectors to use squeezed light to reduce
  quantum noise\cite{2015PhRvD..91f2005M}, the use of
  speedmeters\cite{2014MUPB...69..519V,2002gr.qc....11088K}, or atom
  interferometry\cite{2013PhRvL.110q1102G,2016PhRvD..93b1101C,2008PhRvD..78l2002D}.

  At the very low-frequency limit of the gravitational wave spectrum
  the bulk of detection efforts rotate around pulsar timing arrays,
  which promise the detection of gravitational waves by precision
  measurements of pulse arrival times from a number of pulsars
  distributed across the sky. By observing correlated
  delays\cite{1983ApJ...265L..39H} in arrival times the presence of a
  very long wavelength gravitational wave can be inferred. There are a
  number of collaborations actively producing pulsar observations with
  the aim of detecting gravitational waves: the \gls{epta}\cite{2013CQGra..30v4009K},
  NANOGrav\cite{2009arXiv0909.1058J}, the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array
  (PPTA)\cite{2013PASA...30...17M}, and the International Pulsar
  Timing Array (IPTA) collaboration\cite{2013CQGra..30v4010M}. % The
  % calculated effective ASD for the IPTA is shown in figure
