In the most energetic explosions in the
universe---supernovae---enormous quantities of mass travel at close to
the speed of light. The explosion of a supernova is likely to be a
highly chaotic event, and as a result, highly asymmetrical. This
asymmetrical explosion can therefore produce gravitational waves. Our
understanding of the precise dynamics of supernovae are quite poorly
understood, but thanks to the large quantities of energy involved in a
supernova it is possible (albeit optimistically) to predict that
core-collapse supernovae should produce gravitational waves in the
LIGO bandpass at an amplitude which could have been detected with the
initial LIGO detector\cite{2009LRR....12....2S}.
