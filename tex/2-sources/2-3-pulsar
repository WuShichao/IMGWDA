The discovery of pulsars by Bell and Hewish in 1967 was an unexpected
discovery for radio astronomy---objects which produce beams of
radiation, and rotate rapidly, like a lighthouse. Not long after their
discovery it became apparent that they were a specific form of neutron
star---the tightly-packed remnant of a massive star which has ended
its life as a supernova.

Being highly-dense, and having a rapid rotation (and hence an
acceleration), pulsars are strong candidates for producing
gravitational radiation. Any irregularity in their structure, such as
a bulge (or a mountain) on their surface. These gravitational waves
will produce a weak signal in the detector, but by observing for long
periods of time, it is possible to make very sensitive measurements,
thanks to the periodicity of the signal.

While no observations of gravitational waves from a pulsar have been
made so far, the lack of any detection by the initial LIGO and VIRGO
interferometers has provided a result in its own right. The
sensitivity of these detectors is well understood, and the
\emph{sensitive distance}, the distance to which the detector is
capable of making an observation, has been calculated. This allows us
to exclude the Crab pulsar, for example, from having any asymmetry
greater than one part in 10\,000 in its shape\cite{2009LRR....12....2S}, corresponding to a maximum surface
irregularity of 30\,cm\cite{2014ApJ...785..119A}.
