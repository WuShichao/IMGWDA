  A pair of orbiting objects can also produce gravitational waves, and
  as they do so their orbit loses energy, causing the radius of the
  orbit to shrink\cite{1995PhRvL..74.3515B}. The objects spiral in
  towards each other. This behaviour has already been observed in the
  Hulse-Taylor
  pulsar\cite{1975ApJ...195L..51H,2005ASPC..328...25W}, a system
  of two neutron stars---one of which is a pulsar--- which, through
  precise pulsar timing measurements, have been inferred to be
  inspiralling, and producing gravitational waves.

  The binary system will continue to lose energy via gravitational
  radiation until it reaches its \emph{innermost stable circular
    orbit}, after which the objects will merge, and eventually
  coalesce. This coalescence will be a powerful source of
  gravitational waves, and the chirp produced by the coalescence may
  be sufficiently luminous to be detected by current, advanced
  detectors, (attempts to detect signals from such coalescing systems
  were also made during the initial run of the
  detectors\cite{2012PhRvD..85h2002A}) and would be characterised by
  the distinct pattern of the pseudo-sinusoidal inspiral waveform,
  followed by a bright burst of radiation, and then a sinusoidal
  ``ringdown'' as the post-coalescence remnant
  vibrates\cite{2009LRR....12....2S}. Binary coalescences are thus
  classified as transient, or burst sources.

The potential objects which may be involved in an observable binary
coalescence are black holes and neutron stars: both compact
objects. White dwarf binaries may also be observable, and these
systems are expected to be much more abundant than either neutron star
or black hole binaries, but their emission lies within the passband of
LISA---a planned space-based gravitational wave observatory. These
never reach a last stable orbit, as it lies within their physical
diameter, and so the inspiral component of the waveform is the
principle source of gravitational waves. These are expected to be so
numerous in LISA results\cite{2013GWN.....6....4A} that entirely new statistical methods will be
needed to process the observations, and to allow observations of other
phenomena to be made in their background.

Supermassive binary black holes (SMBBH) are believed to collide and
merge as part of the merging processes of galaxies. Again these
binaries should produce signals within the passband of LISA\cite{2012CQGra..29l4016A}, and
should be so spectacuarly strong that they are visible in the LISA
data without the \emph{matched filtering} techniques which are
required to extract other signals from the data\cite{2009LRR....12....2S}. The observation of
these objects would provide much-needed information about the
evolution of galaxies and of super-massive black holes.

Inspiralling compact binaries can act as a cosmological distance
measure: they have two parameters, their period, and the rate at which
that period changes (which is calculated by measuring the \emph{chirp
  mass} of the system) which characterise the system, and the
amplitude of the gravitational waves produced is dependent only on the
chirp mass of the source, and the distance from the observer to the
object. As a result it is possible to determine the distance to an
inspiralling system simply by determining the chirp mass and measuring
the brightness of the event. This would provide an additional means of
measuring cosmic acceleration, and, in the LISA era, this would allow
the measurement of acceleration at high redshift using high-mass
binary black holes.
