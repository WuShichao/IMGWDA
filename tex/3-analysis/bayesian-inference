Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference which is
well-suited to situations where a body of evidence grows over time,
with new results updating previous understanding of some phenomenon,
and as such is well suited to the analysis of experimental data, and
is well suited to the analysis of gravitational wave data, where
measurements are frequently made at different sensitivities during
different observing runs.

If we have some hypothesis, some parameters of the hypothesis, $I$
(so-called hyperparameters) and some experimental data, we can
determine the probability of the hypothesis via
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bayestheorem}
  p(\text{hypothesis} | \text{data}, I) \propto p( \text{data} | \text{hypothesis}) \times p(\text{hypothesis}, I)
\end{equation}
where $p(\text{data} | \text{hypothesis})$ represents the likelihood
of the data, in-effect the degree to which we trust the measurements,
for example, and $p(\text{hypothesis}|I)$ represents the \emph{prior}
probability, which represents the understanding of the probability of
the hypothesis before the experiment was
conducted. $p({\text{hypothesis} | \text{data}, I)$ is the
  \emph{posterior} probability of the
  hypothesis\cite{skilling2006data}.

  Bayesian inference can then be used as a powerful method for
  \emph{model selection}, where the posterior probabilities of two
  competing models are compared, with a greater posterior probability
  indicating greater support for a given model.
