Matched filtering is a powerful technique for the extraction of low
SNR signals from noisy data. The method relies on the prior knowledge
of the shape of the signal: this reference signal, called a
\emph{template} is then cross-correlated with the data. By performing
matched filtering with a large number of templates, and then using
Bayesian model selection, it is possible to perform parameter
estimation using matched filtering\cite{2007PhRvD..76d3003C}.
