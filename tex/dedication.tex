\lettrine{I}{'ve had} the pleasure of being a member of the Institute for
Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow for a little over
seven months. It would be difficult to deny that this has been an
unexpectedly eventful period in the life of the group, and it's been
great fun to experience the excitement of the first detection of a
gravitational wave as an insider (although an insider only by the skin
of my teeth), and to see the department's work on the LISA Pathfinder
mission come to fruition just a few months later.  

The work outlined in this report comprises a number of projects which
I have spent these seven months working on, however the first
observing run of Advanced LIGO proved more disruptive to my schedule
than was, perhaps, initially envisaged.
