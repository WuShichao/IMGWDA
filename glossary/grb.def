Gamma ray burst. These are short-lived electromagnetic events which are highly luminous, especially within the gamma ray regime of the spectrum. Events lasting for less than around \si{2}{\second} are classified as ``short'' GRBs (sGRB), while the rest are long GRBs. sGRBs are believed to be the result of binary neutron star coalescence.
