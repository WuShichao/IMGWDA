\lettrine{I}{'ve had} the pleasure of being a member of the Institute for
Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow for a little over
seven months. It would be difficult to deny that this has been an
unexpectedly eventful period in the life of the group, and it's been
great fun to experience the excitement of the first detection of a
gravitational wave as an insider (although an insider only by the skin
of my teeth), and to see the department's work on the LISA Pathfinder
mission come to fruition just a few months later.  

The work outlined in this report comprises a number of projects which
I have spent these seven months working on, however the first
observing run of Advanced LIGO proved more disruptive to my schedule
than was, perhaps, initially envisaged.

\epigraph{I guess we need to do the detection checklist...}{\textbf{Sergey Klimencko}, \emph{Internal LSC communication}, 14 September 2015}

\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{he 14 September 2016} will likely be remembered as one of the most
significant in the history of astronomy and of astrophysics. Early in
the morning of this autumn day, shortly after 9am UT, a gravitational
wave passed through the Earth, and on its way produced a sufficiently
large movement in the mirrors and test masses of the detectors of the
Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (\gls{LIGO}), as to be
detected.

Over five months of data analysis, detector characterisation, and
detection verification were conducted by a global team of scientists,
in the LIGO and VIRGO Scientific Collaboration (LVC). This process
resulted in a slew of journal papers being written, vast quantities of
data produced, and an enormous public outreach effort to be
launched. Eventually, the collaboration found itself in a position to
make the announcement of the first detection of gravitational waves on
11 February 2016.


\section{Gravitational Waves and General Relativity}
\label{sec:grav-waves-gener}

Gravitational waves are one of the predictions of Einstein's 1915
Theory of General Relativity.

\chapter{Detectors}
\label{cha:detectors}

\chapterprecis{Gravitational wave detectors are one of the great
  achievements of Twentieth and early Twenty-First Century
  science. They are the most sensitive measuring devices ever
  constructed, but they face numerous technical challenges.}

The earliest attempts to develop a gravitational wave detector were
made in the 1960s with the experiments of Jospeh Weber at California
Institute of Technology. The field has since evolved to the sensitive
laser interferometric observatories run by CalTech and VIRGO.

\section{Detector architectures}
\label{sec:detect-arch}

\subsection{Resonant bar detectors}
\label{sec:reson-bar-detect}

\section{Ground-based interferometers}
\label{sec:ground-based-interf}

The cutting-edge of current ground-based interferometers are the twin
Advanced LIGO detectors \cite{2015CQGra..32g4001L} located in Hanford,
WA, USA, and Livingston, LA, USA. These interferometers are Michelson
interferometers with a large number of additional components, which
allow detection of differential changes in their arm lengths (strains)
on the order of $10^{-22}$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Detecting gravitational waves with light}
\label{sec:interferometricdetection}

Gravitational-wave detectors which use beams of light, such as
interferometers and pulsar timing arrays rely on measuring the the
travel time of a beam of electromagnetic radiation between two points,
and the effect that a gravitational wave has on this time. A full
treatment of this is given in \cite{2009LRR....12....2S}, but in
summary, if a gravitational wave is not present within a detector, the
travel time of a beam will be constant. If a gravitational waev is
introduced, which has a polarisation component $h_+(t)$ in the plane
of the beam, the change in the arrival time of the beam will be
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:arrival-times-gw}
  \dv{t_f}{t} = 1 + \half (1 + \cos(\theta)) \qty{ 
    h_+\qty( t + [1- \cos(\theta) ] L) - h_+(t) 
  }
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle separating the detector beam and the
gravitational wave plane, and $L$ is the proper distance separating
the clocks when no gravitational wave is present.

By arranging the detector to reflect the beam back to the originating
clock, it is possible to measure the round-triop time using only one
clock. In this arrangement we must account for the gravitational wave
having a different strength one the return trip, and so equation
(\ref{eq:arrival-times-gw}) becomes 
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:three-term}
  \dv{t~{round}}{t} = 1 + \half \Big(  (& 1-\cos(\theta) )h_+ (t+2L) - (1+\cos(\theta))h_+(t) \nonumber \\ & + 2 \cos(\theta) h_+ [t+L(1 - \cos(\theta))] \Big)
\end{align}
the \emph{three-term} relation.

A Michelson interferometer is an optical device which is capable of
measuring the difference in length between two optical paths to
sub-wavelength precision. A Michelson interferometer can be
constructed using a beamsplitter and two mirrors, in the configuration
presented in figure \ref{fig:michelson}. The input beam is split along
the $x$ and $y$ directions, and reflected back to the
beam-splitter. At the beam-splitter the two beams will interfere: in
the standard Michelson setup this will result in constructive
interference if the arms have identical lengths, and a beam will be
produced at the output (the dashed red line). If the arms' relative
lengths change a pattern of interference fringes will be visible at
the output of the interferometer.

\subsection{Newtonian Noise}
\label{sec:newtonian-noise}

Newtonian noise, or gravitational gradient noise, is the strain
produced by gravitational coupling between local mass density
variations and the test masses in the interferometer. Examples of
significant sources of Newtonian noise include clouds passing overhead
the detector, and seismic perturbations in the local ground density.

\subsection{Seismic Noise}
\label{sec:seismic-noise}

Seismic noise is the result of strain introduced into the
interferometer through movement of the ground, which can be the result
of geophysical activity, tidal activity, or anthropogenic sources of
seismic noise, such as road traffic or railways. Seismic noise is also
a source of Newtonian noise (see section \ref{sec:newtonian-noise})
due to density fluctuations as the seismic wave passes through the
ground.

%   \end{tabular}
% }

Seismic noise limits the sensitivity of the second generation
detectors at low frequencies ($f < \SI{10}{\hertz}$), but it is
present as a noise source across the passband of the detector. The
seismic noise shows a pair of notable peaks below the $\SI{1}{\hertz}$
level, one caused by ocean swell, which has a period around 4 to 30
seconds, and a second caused by standing seismic modes in the Earth
which spans the range of 30 to 1000 seconds.

Seismic isolation is used in detectors to reduce the noise level due
to seismic activity. This takes two forms: active isolation, and
passive isolation. The former is accomplished by mounting optical
components on servo-controlled systems which are controlled, via a
feedback-loop, to a seismometer. The latter is reduced by suspending
the optics as a component in a pendulum system. In the Advanced LIGO
design this involves the test masses and their associated mirrors
composing the final component in a quadruple pendulum suspension.



\subsection{Other noise sources}
\label{sec:other-noise-sources}

There are numerous additional noise sources within the interferometer.

\chapter{Sources of Gravitational Waves}
\label{cha:sourc-grav-waves}

\chapterprecis{Gravitational waves are produced by any situation
  containing accelerating masses which are arranged in an asymmetrical
  manner, for example binary star systems, or non-spherical pulsars. A
  wide range of astrophysical sources are capable of producing
  gravitational waves, although only a handful of these are likely to
  be luminous enough to detect, or produce radiation over a frequency
  band which can be detected by current-generation detectors.}

The astrophysical sources of gravitational waves can be divided
roughly into three categories\cite{2009LRR....12....2S}. Continuous
sources are expected to produce radiation constantly, or at least over
long periods of time. Transient sources, on the other hand, produce
high-intensity radiation for a short period of time. We also expect an
underlying background of gravitational waves to exist, which result
from the superposition of waves from the multitudes of sources
throughout the universe, in addition to the remnants of the big bang
itself.

\section{Transient Sources}
\label{sec:transient-sources}

Transient sources of gravitational waves...

\subsection{Compact Binary Coalescence}
\label{sec:cbc}

A pair of orbiting objects can also produce gravitational waves, and
as they do so their orbit loses energy, causing the radius of the
orbit to shrink. The objects spiral in towards each other. This
behaviour has already been observed in the Hulse-Taylor
pulsar\cite{1975ApJ...195L..51H}\cite{2005ASPC..328...25W}, a system
of two neutron stars---one of which is a pulsar--- which, through
precise pulsar timing measurements, have been inferred to be
inspiralling, and producing gravitational waves.

The binary system will continue to lose energy via gravitational
radiation until it reaches its \emph{last stable orbit}, after which
the objects will `touch', and eventually coalesce. This coalescence
will be a powerful source of gravitational waves, and the chirp
produced by the coalescence may be sufficiently luminous to be
detected by current, advanced detectors, (attempts to detect signals
from such coalescing systems were also made during the initial run of
the detectors\cite{2012PhRvD..85h2002A}) and would be characterised by
the distinct pattern of the pseudo-sinusoidal inspiral waveform,
followed by a bright burst of radiation, and then a sinusoidal
``ringdown'' as the post-coalescence remnant
vibrates\cite{2009LRR....12....2S}. Binary coalescences are thus
classified as transient, or burst sources.

The potential objects which may be involved in an observable binary
coalescence are black holes and neutron stars: both compact
objects. White dwarf binaries may also be observable, and these
systems are expected to be much more abundant than either neutron star
or black hole binaries, but their emission lies within the passband of
LISA---a planned space-based gravitational wave observatory. These
never reach a last stable orbit, as it lies within their physical
diameter, and so the inspiral component of the waveform is the
principle source of gravitational waves. These are expected to be so
numerous in LISA results\cite{2013GWN.....6....4A} that entirely new statistical methods will be
needed to process the observations, and to allow observations of other
phenomena to be made in their background.

Supermassive binary black holes (SMBBH) are believed to collide and
merge as part of the merging processes of galaxies. Again these
binaries should produce signals within the passband of LISA\cite{2012CQGra..29l4016A}, and
should be so spectacuarly strong that they are visible in the LISA
data without the \emph{matched filtering} techniques which are
required to extract other signals from the data\cite{2009LRR....12....2S}. The observation of
these objects would provide much-needed information about the
evolution of galaxies and of super-massive black holes.

Inspiralling compact binaries can act as a cosmological distance
measure: they have two parameters, their period, and the rate at which
that period changes (which is calculated by measuring the \emph{chirp
  mass} of the system) which characterise the system, and the
amplitude of the gravitational waves produced is dependent only on the
chirp mass of the source, and the distance from the observer to the
object. As a result it is possible to determine the distance to an
inspiralling system simply by determining the chirp mass and measuring
the brightness of the event. This would provide an additional means of
measuring cosmic acceleration, and, in the LISA era, this would allow
the measurement of acceleration at high redshift using high-mass
binary black holes.

\subsection{Core-collapse Supernovae}
\label{sec:sn}

In the most energetic explosions in the
universe---supernovae---enormous quantities of mass travel at close to
the speed of light. The explosion of a supernova is likely to be a
highly chaotic event, and as a result, highly asymmetrical. This
asymmetrical explosion can therefore produce gravitational waves. Our
understanding of the precise dynamics of supernovae are quite poorly
understood, but thanks to the large quantities of energy involved in a
supernova it is possible (albeit optimistically) to predict that
core-collapse supernovae should produce gravitational waves in the
LIGO bandpass at an amplitude which could have been detected with the
initial LIGO detector\cite{2009LRR....12....2S}.

\section{Continuous Sources}
\label{sec:continuous-sources}

\subsection{Gravitational-wave Pulsars}
\label{sec:pulsar}

The discovery of pulsars by Bell and Hewish in 1967 was an unexpected
discovery for radio astronomy---objects which produce beams of
radiation, and rotate rapidly, like a lighthouse. Not long after their
discovery it became apparent that they were a specific form of neutron
star---the tightly-packed remnant of a massive star which has ended
its life as a supernova.

Being highly-dense, and having a rapid rotation (and hence an
acceleration), pulsars are strong candidates for producing
gravitational radiation. Any irregularity in their structure, such as
a bulge (or a mountain) on their surface. These gravitational waves
will produce a weak signal in the detector, but by observing for long
periods of time, it is possible to make very sensitive measurements,
thanks to the periodicity of the signal.

While no observations of gravitational waves from a pulsar have been
made so far, the lack of any detection by the initial LIGO and VIRGO
interferometers has provided a result in its own right. The
sensitivity of these detectors is well understood, and the
\emph{sensitive distance}, the distance to which the detector is
capable of making an observation, has been calculated. This allows us
to exclude the Crab pulsar, for example, from having any asymmetry
greater than one part in 10\,000 in its shape\cite{2009LRR....12....2S}, corresponding to a maximum surface
irregularity of 30\,cm\cite{2014ApJ...785..119A}.

\section{Stochastic Sources}
\label{sec:stochastic-sources}

While the gravitational wave detections which we expect to make with
the aLIGO and aVIRGO detectors in the next five years all correspond
to radiation from specific sources, in the LISA era we expect to
encounter a new phenomenon: the gravitational wave
background\cite{2009LRR....12....2S}. This is likely to come from a
number of sources. LISA will be sensitive to compact binary systems
for a much longer period of their evolution, and so rather than just
detecting the final few orbits and the coalescense of objects, we will
be able to observe decades or more of their inspiral. Given the large
population of binary objects in the universe, and the ability of LISA
to detect white dwarf binaries, we can expect the existence of a rich
gravitational wave background at low frequencies: so much so that the
data-handling task will be many orders of magnitude more complicated
than that for the advanced era detectors.  Super-massive binary black
holes throughout the universe will also contribute to this background.

Currently-favoured theories of cosmology favour the existence of a
period of cosmological inflation, a process which should have produced
very low-frequency gravitational waves.  These were the focus of the
ultimately-refuted BICEP2 announcement\cite{2014PhRvL.112x1101B} of
the discovery of gravitational waves.
