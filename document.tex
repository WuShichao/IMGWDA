\section{Ground-based interferometers}
\label{sec:ground-based-interf}

The cutting-edge of current ground-based interferometers are the twin
Advanced LIGO detectors \cite{2015CQGra..32g4001L} located in Hanford,
WA, USA, and Livingston, LA, USA. These interferometers are Michelson
interferometers with a large number of additional components, which
allow detection of differential changes in their arm lengths (strains)
on the order of $10^{-22}$.

\subsection{Detecting gravitational waves with light}
\label{sec:interferometricdetection}

Gravitational-wave detectors which use beams of light, such as
interferometers and pulsar timing arrays rely on measuring the the
travel time of a beam of electromagnetic radiation between two points,
and the effect that a gravitational wave has on this time. A full
treatment of this is given in \cite{2009LRR....12....2S}, but in
summary, if a gravitational wave is not present within a detector, the
travel time of a beam will be constant. If a gravitational waev is
introduced, which has a polarisation component $h_+(t)$ in the plane
of the beam, the change in the arrival time of the beam will be
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:arrival-times-gw}
  \dv{t_f}{t} = 1 + \half (1 + \cos(\theta)) \qty{ 
    h_+\qty( t + [1- \cos(\theta) ] L) - h_+(t) 
  }
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle separating the detector beam and the
gravitational wave plane, and $L$ is the proper distance separating
the clocks when no gravitational wave is present.

By arranging the detector to reflect the beam back to the originating
clock, it is possible to measure the round-triop time using only one
clock. In this arrangement we must account for the gravitational wave
having a different strength one the return trip, and so equation
(\ref{eq:arrival-times-gw}) becomes 
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:three-term}
  \dv{t~{round}}{t} = 1 + \half \Big(  (& 1-\cos(\theta) )h_+ (t+2L) - (1+\cos(\theta))h_+(t) \nonumber \\ & + 2 \cos(\theta) h_+ [t+L(1 - \cos(\theta))] \Big)
\end{align}
the \emph{three-term} relation.

%
A Michelson interferometer is an optical device which is capable of
measuring the difference in length between two optical paths to
sub-wavelength precision. A Michelson interferometer can be
constructed using a beamsplitter and two mirrors, in the configuration
presented in figure \ref{fig:michelson}. The input beam is split along
the $x$ and $y$ directions, and reflected back to the
beam-splitter. At the beam-splitter the two beams will interfere: in
the standard Michelson setup this will result in constructive
interference if the arms have identical lengths, and a beam will be
produced at the output (the dashed red line). If the arms' relative
lengths change a pattern of interference fringes will be visible at
the output of the interferometer.

  using a comparable setup to figure \ref{fig:michelson}, but with a

} 
%
The optimal signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved from an
interferometer when the arm lengths are configured so that when no
gravitational wave is present in the interferometer the interferometer
beams interfere destructively \cite{1978JPhE...11..710E}. If the
mirrors are low loss the light will then be reflected back towards the
laser, and by placing a mirror between the laser and the beam splitter
a resonant cavity can be formed (see figure \ref{fig:power-recycle}),
allowing the power in the interferometer to build up. This allows a
less powerful laser to be used as the input for the interferometer,
with a \SI{10}{\watt} laser capable of providing several kilowatts of
power inside the interferometer \cite{2011LRR....14....5P}.

    \draw [ultra thick] (0.8, 2.15) rectangle (1.4, 2.35);

\captionof{figure}{A Michelson interferometer with signal recycling,
  using a comparable setup to figure \ref{fig:michelson}, but with a
  mirror added between the output and the beam splitter. \label{fig:signal-recycle}}
} 
%
Signal recycling can be used to tune the bandwidth of an
interferometer, and to increase its sensitivity by re-injecting the
interferometer's output signal to the interferometer, achieving
resonance, which increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the
signal. This is possible thanks to the sidebands on the beam which are
produced by the gravitational wave not interfering destructively.

To perform signal recycling a mirror is added between the
beam-splitter and the readout port of the interferometer, with this
configuration illustrated in figure \ref{fig:signal-recycle}.

  using a comparable setup to figure \ref{fig:signal-recycle}, but with a

}
%
The arms of modern interferometers used in the detection of
gravitational-waves store the beam for a period of time comparable to
the timescale of the signals which are being searched for. In the case
of kilometre-scale detectors and signals with a period around
\SI{1}{\milli\second} this implies the need for the light to reflect
up-and-down the detector around $50$ times. This is achieved by laying
the reflected beams atop each other in a Fabry-Perot cavity, with a
\gls{finesse}, $\mathcal{F}=50$. A Fabry-Perot cavity is formed by
placing a mirror between the beam-splitter and the end mirror in each
arm, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:fabry-perot}.

\subsection{Newtonian Noise}
\label{sec:newtonian-noise}

Newtonian noise, or gravitational gradient noise, is the strain
produced by gravitational coupling between local mass density
variations and the test masses in the interferometer. Examples of
significant sources of Newtonian noise include clouds passing overhead
the detector, and seismic perturbations in the local ground density.

\subsection{Seismic Noise}
\label{sec:seismic-noise}

Seismic noise is the result of strain introduced into the
interferometer through movement of the ground, which can be the result
of geophysical activity, tidal activity, or anthropogenic sources of
seismic noise, such as road traffic or railways. Seismic noise is also
a source of Newtonian noise (see section \ref{sec:newtonian-noise})
due to density fluctuations as the seismic wave passes through the
ground.

%     0.01--1.0    &  1000         & earthquakes, microseism
%   \end{tabular}
% }

Seismic noise limits the sensitivity of the second generation
detectors at low frequencies ($f < \SI{10}{\hertz}$), but it is
present as a noise source across the passband of the detector. The
seismic noise shows a pair of notable peaks below the $\SI{1}{\hertz}$
level, one caused by ocean swell, which has a period around 4 to 30
seconds, and a second caused by standing seismic modes in the Earth
which spans the range of 30 to 1000 seconds.

Seismic isolation is used in detectors to reduce the noise level due
to seismic activity. This takes two forms: active isolation, and
passive isolation. The former is accomplished by mounting optical
components on servo-controlled systems which are controlled, via a
feedback-loop, to a seismometer. The latter is reduced by suspending
the optics as a component in a pendulum system. In the Advanced LIGO
design this involves the test masses and their associated mirrors
composing the final component in a quadruple pendulum suspension.



\subsection{Other noise sources}
\label{sec:other-noise-sources}

There are numerous additional noise sources within the interferometer.

\chapter{Sources of Gravitational Waves}
\label{cha:sourc-grav-waves}

\chapterprecis{Gravitational waves are produced by any situation
  containing accelerating masses which are arranged in an asymmetrical
  manner, for example binary star systems, or non-spherical pulsars. A
  wide range of astrophysical sources are capable of producing
  gravitational waves, although only a handful of these are likely to
  be luminous enough to detect, or produce radiation over a frequency
  band which can be detected by current-generation detectors.}

The astrophysical sources of gravitational waves can be divided
roughly into three categories\cite{2009LRR....12....2S}. Continuous
sources are expected to produce radiation constantly, or at least over
long periods of time. Transient sources, on the other hand, produce
high-intensity radiation for a short period of time. We also expect an
underlying background of gravitational waves to exist, which result
from the superposition of waves from the multitudes of sources
throughout the universe, in addition to the remnants of the big bang
itself.

During the period September 2015 --- April 2016 I contributed to one
LSC author-list paper, the so-called \emph{Burst Companion Paper}, for
which I was the figures editor. At present I am not on the general LSC
author-list, and as such I am not a named contributor on any of the
other collaboration papers produced over this time period.

During the same period I have been a co-author on a short-author list
paper, and the lead author on a paper composing the write-up of my
MSci project.
