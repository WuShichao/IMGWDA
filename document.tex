% \section{Work thus far}

% In the first six months of my PhD my work has been focussed primarily
% on the use of Gaussian Processes in gravitational astrophysics, with a
% specific focus on using Gaussian processes to estimate the uncertainty
% in post-Newtonian approximants to numerical relativity waveforms. The
% ultimate aim of this project is to identify the parameters at which
% new numerical relativity waveforms should be produced in an
% algorithmic and Bayesian manner.

% \section{Gaussian processes for gravitational wave detection}
% \label{sec:gauss-proc-grav}

% Gaussian processes have the attractive feature that they can be
% leveraged to produce a regression of data, which has both the
% equivalent of a ``best-fit'' line, which is represented by the mean
% function from the posterior, and an uncertainty, through the variance
% of the posterior. In matched filtering techniques used in LIGO data
% analysis it is often impractical to use numerical relativity (NR)
% waveforms, owing to their computational expense, and so approximants
% must be used to span the regions of parameter space between the
% ``true'' NR waveforms.

% Moore and Gair\cite{2014PhRvL.113y1101M,2016PhRvD..93f4001M} propose a
% method to account for the uncertainty which is introduced through the
% use of an approximant, by training a Gaussian process on the
% differences between NR and approximant waveforms. They then use the
% posterior from the Gaussian process to form the likelihood in their
% analysis. While this approach is shown to improve the efficiency of
% bayesian inference techniques on parameter estimation, it relies on
% the availability of an analytic or a semi-analytic approximant to the
% true values.

% Instead, I have attempted to take the approach of training a Gaussian
% process directly using the numerical relativity waveforms produced by
% the Relativity Group at Georgia Tech\cite{gatechcat}: here the input
% parameters are multi-dimensional, composed of the time, and the
% simulation parameters, and the strain values at each of these points
% composing the targets.

% This approach allows two useful results to be obtained: first, it
% allows the production of gravitational waveforms, with associated
% error estimates, directly from the NR data, bypassing the need for an
% approximant; second, a fully trained Gaussian process, through its
% ability to estimate the uncertainty in any prediction, provides a
% means to indetify regions of parameter space where predictions are
% likely to be particuarly poor, and is thus a means of identifying the
% optimal regions of parameter space to focus future simulation efforts
% on.

% An extra direction has recently appeared which I have actively
% pursued, relating to Gaussian processes. Where previously Gaussian
% processes had been trained to produce a single-dimensional output from
% a multi-dimensional input, I have been attempting to develop a
% technique where a multiple-dimensional input is used to prouduce a
% multiple-dimensional output. The specific intention of this method is
% to provide a timeseries which contains a gravitational wave signal to
% a Gaussian process, and use it to predict the model parameters which
% produced it. In effect, this technique would be a means of performing
% parameter estimation using purely NR data. Perfecting this technique
% is likely to be difficult, however, as it poses formidable problems
% with computability, and will require careful thought about memory
% optimisation. An ultimate aim for such an algorithm would be the
% abiltiy to produce a posterior on multiple waveform parameters
% directly from noisy data from a gravitational wave detector.

% \section{Minke: Producing MDCs for gravitational wave transient analysis}
% \label{sec:mink-prod-mdcs}

% In order to characterise the efficiency of any gravitational wave
% analysis algorithm it must be tested on injected signals---simulated
% signals with known parameters, and hence a known shape---which are
% inserted into either simulated noise, or timeseries containing real
% noise from the detector. By determining the number of these injected
% signals which are detected by an algorithm it is possible to determine
% the detection efficiency of the method; additionally, this method
% allows a controlled method of determining the quietest events the
% algorithm is capable of detecting in the noise environment, and hence
% of calculating the sensitive distance of the detector and analysis to
% a physical system producing a waveform with those parameters.

% LSC author-list paper, the so-called \emph{Burst Companion Paper}, for
% which I was the figures editor. At present I am not on the general LSC
