\subsection{Newtonian Noise}
\label{sec:newtonian-noise}

Newtonian noise, or gravitational gradient noise, is the strain
produced by gravitational coupling between local mass density
variations and the test masses in the interferometer. Examples of
significant sources of Newtonian noise include clouds passing overhead
the detector, and seismic perturbations in the local ground density.

\subsection{Seismic Noise}
\label{sec:seismic-noise}

Seismic noise is the result of strain introduced into the
interferometer through movement of the ground, which can be the result
of geophysical activity, tidal activity, or anthropogenic sources of
seismic noise, such as road traffic or railways. Seismic noise is also
a source of Newtonian noise (see section \ref{sec:newtonian-noise})
due to density fluctuations as the seismic wave passes through the
ground.

Seismic noise limits the sensitivity of the second generation
detectors at low frequencies ($f < \SI{10}{\hertz}$), but it is
present as a noise source across the passband of the detector. The
seismic noise shows a pair of notable peaks below the $\SI{1}{\hertz}$
level, one caused by ocean swell, which has a period around 4 to 30
seconds, and a second caused by standing seismic modes in the Earth
which spans the range of 30 to 1000 seconds.

Seismic isolation is used in detectors to reduce the noise level due
to seismic activity. This takes two forms: active isolation, and
passive isolation. The former is accomplished by mounting optical
components on servo-controlled systems which are controlled, via a
feedback-loop, to a seismometer. The latter is reduced by suspending
the optics as a component in a pendulum system. In the Advanced LIGO
design this involves the test masses and their associated mirrors
composing the final component in a quadruple pendulum suspension.



\subsection{Other noise sources}
\label{sec:other-noise-sources}

There are numerous additional noise sources within the interferometer.

\chapter{Sources of Gravitational Waves}
\label{cha:sourc-grav-waves}

\chapterprecis{Gravitational waves are produced by any situation
  containing accelerating masses which are arranged in an asymmetrical
  manner, for example binary star systems, or non-spherical pulsars. A
  wide range of astrophysical sources are capable of producing
  gravitational waves, although only a handful of these are likely to
  be luminous enough to detect, or produce radiation over a frequency
  band which can be detected by current-generation detectors.}

The astrophysical sources of gravitational waves can be divided
roughly into three categories\cite{2009LRR....12....2S}. Continuous
sources are expected to produce radiation constantly, or at least over
long periods of time. Transient sources, on the other hand, produce
high-intensity radiation for a short period of time. We also expect an
underlying background of gravitational waves to exist, which result
from the superposition of waves from the multitudes of sources
throughout the universe, in addition to the remnants of the big bang
itself.

\chapter{Presentations \& publications}
\label{chap:pandp}

During the period September 2015 --- April 2016 I contributed to one
LSC author-list paper, the so-called \emph{Burst Companion Paper}, for
which I was the figures editor. At present I am not on the general LSC
author-list, and as such I am not a named contributor on any of the
other collaboration papers produced over this time period.

During the same period I have been a co-author on a short-author list
paper, and the lead author on a paper composing the write-up of my
MSci project.
